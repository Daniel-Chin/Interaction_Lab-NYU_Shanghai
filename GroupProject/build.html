<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Interaction is giving and receiving attention.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Interaction with physical computing is:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>A dead thing making a living thing feel they are given attention. </b>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<h2 style="font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 2pt; padding-bottom: 2pt; margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">2 projects I researched&nbsp;</h2><hr />
<h3 style="font-size: 18pt; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 2pt; padding-bottom: 2pt; margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://www.creativeapplications.net/objects/alias-a-teachable-parasite-for-your-smart-assistant/">Parasite of Alexa</a>&nbsp;</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This project is a Man In Middle between Amazon Alexa and the user. It acts as a firewall, protecting the user's privacy. The device sits on top of an Alexa, playing a random noise to the Alexa's microphone. Only when the device hears the user speak specific wake words will it stop playing the random noise for a while.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">I think it is a good initiative, but not an interactive device. Its idea very well manifest social science priciples like the Division of Power and Mutual Supervision. It protects privacy. However, The human uses it as a mere tool. The "encapsulation" is so good, the user may as well forget about the existence of the device! It is not a bad thing, just not interactive.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<h3 style="font-size: 18pt; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 2pt; padding-bottom: 2pt; margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://www.creativeapplications.net/member-submissions/scout%e2%80%8a-%e2%80%8aa-smart-home-counterspy-agent/">Smart Home Counterspy Agent</a>&nbsp;</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This project is a router for smart home devices. It displays the traffic of each smart home device with intuitive graphics. The purpose is to reveal to the user how much data their smart home devices upload every day.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">This one is interactive. The user feels they are actively protected. The device communicates with the user. Everytime the user looks at it, the user can feel the amount of thought the device put into its job when the user was not around. That creates emotional sympathy. This is what I mean by "<b>a dead thing making a living thing feel they are given attention.</b> "&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<h2 style="font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 2pt; padding-bottom: 2pt; margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">Group project&nbsp;</h2><hr />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Super Cup is a flying robot that fills your cup for you.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Why robot? Why not a conveyer belt? Why not some other automatic technology that fills the cup remotely?&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The idea is that the user should not take what is provided for granted. A device may be <i>useful</i>, but if the user can easily forget about the device, it is not <i>interactive</i>.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">That is why we decided to use a robot. The robot not only provides water, it also provides attention.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<h2 style="font-size: 24pt; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 2pt; padding-bottom: 2pt; margin-bottom: 0; font-weight: bold;">More thoughts&nbsp;</h2><hr />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><ul><li>Should an interactive design <i>demand</i> attention?  </li><li>In terms of user experience, when is encapsulation good? When bad?  </li></ul>&nbsp;</span><br />
