They have animated textures.  
They pulsate.  
They wiggle.  

## Explanation
I chose the motif because we learnt about the grafitti artist (TEMPT) in earlier lectures through an assistive project. I feel grafitti would be a great genre to replicate in Processing.  

I used OOP to draw random lines to form strokes.  

The coordinates in my final creation are directly taken from the original motif. So, the structure should be identical to the original work. However, my creation is an animation. Details and colors are simplified, but the movements add some expressivity.  

Processing is the perfect tool to achieve my design. Processing provides the right amount of builtin tools for me to easily focus on what I want to do. The OOP provided by Java also helped me generalize the graphics.  

## Source code
The code is too long (5KB), so please see my [Github repo](https://github.com/Daniel-Chin/Processing/tree/master/InkLeakLib).
